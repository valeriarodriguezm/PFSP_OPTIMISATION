# PFSP_OPTIMISATION

Abstract
The permutation flowshop problem is a data science problem with multiple different possible ways to approach. We were elected to utilise random search and genetic algorithms to find the most efficient way to set up a car manufacturing flowshop. We found that genetic algorithm takes longer to run but produces more accurate result than random search.
